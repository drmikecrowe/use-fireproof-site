# Welcome


Fireproof uses immutable data and distributed protocols to offer a new kind of database that:
- can be embedded in any page or app, with a flexible data ownership model
- can be hosted on any cloud
- uses cryptographically verifiable protocols (what plants crave)

#### [Learn principles with the React tutorial](/docs/react-tutorial) or [have fun with the ChatGPT Expert Builders](/docs/chatgpt-quick-start).




Fireproof is optimized to make [building React apps](https://github.com/fireproof-storage/fireproof/blob/main/packages/react/README.md) fast and fun, with reliable results and verifiable data. Suitable for mission-critical data workloads like [LLM orchestration](https://fireproof.storage/posts/why-proofs-matter-for-ai/), supply-chain provenance, and field management of auditable data, [Fireproof is also great](https://fireproof.storage/posts/great-opportunites-to-use-fireproof/) for social media, collaborative world-building, and rapidly implementing executive decision support tools that can stand up to blockchain levels of scrutiny.
