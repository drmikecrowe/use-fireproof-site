# Why Fireproof?


Fireproof enables developers to build powerful data-driven apps without bringing in additional depedencies. This lowers the barrier to creating new apps and makes it easier to add new features to existing apps. Since Fireproof runs with any cloud (or none at all), you can easily add it to your existing apps or write something new.
