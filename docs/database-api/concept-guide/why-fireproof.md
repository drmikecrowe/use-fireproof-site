# Why Fireproof?

Among the local-first and JavaScript database renaissance, Fireproof stands at the intersection of simplicity, power, and reliability. If you need SQL support, there are plenty of options, but Fireproof is written for the browser first, so it does a lot in a little bit of code. Fireproof’s encrypted CRDT storage makes it fit securely into any interactive workload, from the boardroom to the game studio. The live query and background sync don’t require complex web worker builds, just an import statement or a script tag. Fireproof is as accessible from edge functions and server code as it is from a mobile device, so your data is available anywhere your app runs.
