### *Live data anywhere*

### Quickly add live data to any app or page with our embedded database. Reduce risk, cost, and complexity with provable secure synchronization using any backend.

### \[Fireproof Logo\]

**Collaborative:** Multi-user sync for interactive apps

**Fast:** Local-first zero latency database queries

**Easy:** Zero-setup development with one line connection to any cloud

Developers want to build features, not maintain complex stacks. Traditional database setup, maintenance, and operations overhead create a significant hurdle to rapid application development. Centralized architectures fail to offer lightweight operations, embedded performance, mergeable data structures, and the distributed provenance tracking that **make enterprise data integrity possible at the edge**.

Fireproof is an embedded database that brings seamless live sync to any infrastructure, allowing developers to build rich, local-first, collaborative apps that **turn any storage into an end-to-end encrypted, tamperproof ledger**. The technology empowers developers of all skill levels to build trustworthy apps that run anywhere with minimal operational cost and risk. This is aligned with the rise of micro-apps and the resurgence of custom built-for-purpose software unleashed in the AI era.

*Ideal for finance, trading, point-of-sale, shopping cart, ERP, inventory, supply-chain, set-top box, call-center automation, AI agents, social software, pilot scheduling, event data recorder, iOT edge, distributed configuration, and more—**anywhere trust and availability are critical.***

**Testimonials:**

“Fireproof looks like a game changer and I can’t wait for the rest of the world to see it too.”  \- Sunil Pai, Cloudflare PartyKit

“Fireproof’s sync technology makes the server side super cheap and trivial to use.” \- Brad Anderson, SpicyGolf

“Fireproof is an embedded database so it doesn’t require the developer to step outside the tool box and add to the stack.” Daniel Sanchez, Jump Trading

**About the founder:**

Chris Anderson (@jchris) co-founded Couchbase ($BASE), pioneered offline sync with Couchbase Mobile, incubated PouchDB, and hosted the NPM repository. As a leader in the database industry, Chris learned first-hand the importance of working directly with customers to share best practices and reduce risk. Delivering solutions at McKinsey & Company taught him the challenges developers face innovating in today’s enterprises. Seeing the power of immutable data to simplify operational concerns and make sync transparent, he dove into cryptographic integrity at Protocol Labs, and became determined to bring these new techniques to the mainstream with Fireproof.
